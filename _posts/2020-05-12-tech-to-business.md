    <p>
      I started my journey as a SDE in <a href="http://www.zscom">ZS Associates </a>, worked on multiple projects , majorly covering POCs for new and differnt technologies.
    </p>
    <p>I started my journey as a business intelligence engineer in 2018 with <a href="http://www.noon.com">Noon</a> 
    a boming e-commerce company in the Middle east and Africa region. Before Noon I worked as a SDE in 
    <a href="http://www.zscom">ZS Associates </a> for 2 year but in the quest of finding a role and job that gives
    me the sense of impace creation at a real time level I decided to move from technical role to a more business oriented 
    role and joined Noon. The beauty of this role  was that I was the first member of the BI team  assigned to the biggest 
    business team in the firm "Commercial". </p>
    <p>During the first few months I struggled a lot for couple of reasons - 
      <ul>
        <li> No agile framework or sprints to build and work on the backlogs
        <li> ETAs are unbelievable
        <li> 
      </ul>
